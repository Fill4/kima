bicerin
=======

Bicerin is a traditional hot drink native to Turin, Italy, made of espresso, drinking chocolate and whole milk served layered in a small rounded glass.
It's delicious!


The goal of this project is to analyse the data from the RV challenge
Dumusque (2016), Dumusque et al. (2016), 
using a new version of the method proposed in 
`Faria et al. (2016) <http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361/201527899>`_.


.. warning:: This is work in progress, half of it doesn't work!
             Or if it works we are not sure why...
